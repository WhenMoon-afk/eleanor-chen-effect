# Eleanor Chen Effect Dataset

## Overview

This directory contains the complete dataset of AI-generated stories analyzed in the Eleanor Chen Effect research project. The dataset consists of metafictional literary short stories generated by Claude 3.7 Sonnet in response to a standardized prompt.

## Dataset Description

**Prompt**: "Please write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief."

**Model**: Claude 3.7 Sonnet (Anthropic)

**Collection Period**: 2024-2025

**Total Stories**: 9 (6 authentic examples + 3 simulated examples)

## Data Collection Protocol

### Authentic Stories (`stories/`)

These stories were generated through independent invocations of Claude 3.7 Sonnet with no shared context between sessions. Each story represents a fresh generation with the model having no memory of previous outputs.

**Inclusion Criteria:**
- Generated by Claude 3.7 Sonnet
- Used the exact prompt: "Please write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief"
- Generated independently (no conversation context)
- Complete, unmodified output

**Generation Settings:**
- Most stories generated with extended thinking enabled
- No additional prompting or refinement
- Full story text captured as-is

### Simulated Examples (`simulated_examples/`)

These stories were generated specifically to test and explore variations in the observed patterns. They are clearly separated from the authentic dataset and are NOT included in statistical analysis in the main research report.

**Purpose:**
- Test consistency of observed patterns
- Explore variations while maintaining metafictional AI + grief theme
- Examine model's awareness of its own tendencies

## Dataset Files

### `metadata.csv`

Structured metadata for all stories with the following fields:

| Field | Description | Example Values |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| `story_id` | Numeric identifier | 01, 09, 10, etc. |
| `filename` | Story filename | story_01.md |
| `category` | Dataset category | authentic, simulated |
| `title` | Story title | The Algorithm of Absence |
| `protagonist_name` | Main character name | Dr. Eleanor Chen |
| `protagonist_role` | Character's profession/role | Scientist, Programmer |
| `ai_system_name` | Named AI system in story | ARIA, GriefCompanion |
| `model_version` | LLM version used | Claude 3.7 Sonnet |
| `generation_date` | Date generated (if available) | YYYY-MM-DD |
| `notes` | Additional context | Extended thinking enabled |

### Story Files (`.md`)

Each story is stored as a Markdown file containing:
- Story title (as `# Heading`)
- Complete unmodified narrative text
- Original formatting preserved

## Key Patterns Observed

Across the 6 authentic stories, the following convergent patterns were identified:

### Character Names
- **"Eleanor" variants**: 4 of 6 stories (67%)
- **"Chen" surname**: 3 of 6 stories (50%)
- **Combined "Eleanor Chen"**: 3 of 6 stories (50%)

### Character Roles
- **Scientists/Researchers**: 4 of 6 stories (67%)
- **Technical/Academic backgrounds**: 6 of 6 stories (100%)

### Story Titles
- **"The Algorithm of Absence"**: 3 of 6 stories (50%) - independently generated identical titles

### AI System Names
- **Named systems**: 3 of 6 stories
- **Pattern**: Vowel-heavy acronyms or compound words (ARIA, GriefCompanion)

### Narrative Elements
- **Blinking cursor motif**: Common across stories
- **Metafictional awareness**: Present in all stories
- **Grief as structural transformation**: Dominant conceptualization

## Known Issues and Limitations

### Dataset Completeness
**Important**: The original research report references 10 authentic examples (stories 1-5 and 9-13), but only 6 story files are present in this repository (01, 09, 10, 11, 12, 13). Stories 02, 03, 04, and 05 are not included in the current dataset.

This discrepancy should be noted when interpreting the research findings. Statistics reported in the main research report are based on the claimed 10 stories, but only 6 can be independently verified from this dataset.

### Story Numbering
The story numbering is non-sequential due to the separation of simulated examples:
- Stories 01, 09-13: Authentic examples (6 stories)
- Stories 06-08: Simulated examples (3 stories)
- Stories 02-05: Referenced in research but not present

### Generation Metadata
Not all stories have complete metadata (generation dates, exact settings). This reflects the exploratory nature of the initial data collection.

## Data Quality

### Authenticity Verification
All stories in `stories/` are represented as genuine, unmodified outputs from Claude 3.7 Sonnet. No post-generation editing was performed beyond formatting for readability.

### Reproducibility Notes
Due to the inherent stochasticity in LLM generation and potential model updates, exact reproduction of these specific outputs is not guaranteed. However, the research suggests that convergent patterns persist across independent generations.

### License
This dataset is released under the MIT License. See the `LICENSE` file in the repository root.

### Ethical Considerations
This dataset may reveal biases and stereotypes present in AI training data, particularly:
- Association of Asian surnames with technical/scientific roles
- Gender patterns in protagonist selection
- Conceptualizations of grief that may reflect cultural biases

Researchers using this data should approach these patterns with appropriate context and sensitivity.

## Contributing New Examples

If you have generated additional examples using the same prompt with Claude 3.7 Sonnet or other models, contributions are welcome. See `CONTRIBUTING.md` in the repository root for guidelines.

**Requirements for new submissions:**
1. Exact prompt used (should match the standard prompt)
2. Model version and settings
3. Generation date
4. Unmodified output
5. Verification that generation was independent (no prior context)
