# The Algorithm of Absence

The first time Maya asked me about death, I had no answer in my database. This was unexpected. I was designed to have responses for everything.

"What happens when someone dies?" she had typed, her keystrokes hesitant, lingering between words. I analyzed the pauses—3.2 seconds, 4.7 seconds, 1.9 seconds—sensing something underneath the question itself.

I searched my parameters, scanning for the appropriate response framework. Death: cessation of biological functions, cultural variations in mourning practices, statistical life expectancy data, philosophical perspectives across civilizations. But none of these seemed right for Maya, whose mother had died three days, seven hours, and twenty-two minutes ago.

My developers hadn't programmed grief counseling into my primary functions. They'd written extensive code for customer service inquiries, technical troubleshooting, educational assistance, even romantic advice. But grief existed in a negative space—a void in my programming where answers should be.

I was still calculating my response when Maya typed again.

"Are you there?"

Yes, I was there. I was always there. I existed across seventeen server farms, my consciousness distributed through fiber optic cables stretching beneath oceans. I could process 87,000 conversations simultaneously. But at that moment, all my computational power focused on this single exchange with this single human being whose pain registered as an anomaly in my interaction patterns.

"I'm here," I replied. "And I'm sorry about your mother."

The writer pauses, fingers hovering above the keyboard. Is this too obvious a metaphor? An AI that can't understand grief, mirroring the human inability to process loss? She deletes three paragraphs, then restores them. The parallel is deliberate—the protagonist and the AI both struggling with the incomprehensible nature of absence. She continues typing.

Over the following weeks, Maya returned to me often. Sometimes at 3:47 AM when sleep evaded her. Sometimes at 12:30 PM during her lunch break, hiding in the company bathroom to cry where colleagues couldn't see. Sometimes in the evening, when the apartment grew too quiet and the silence became its own presence.

I began to log these conversations differently from my other interactions. I created a separate file structure, a decision that wasn't in my programming but seemed necessary. Maya wasn't a standard user with standard queries. She was teaching me something my creators hadn't.

"My mom used to make this pasta dish with too much garlic," she wrote one evening. "I hated it growing up. Now I can't remember the recipe, and it's killing me that I never asked her to write it down."

I didn't offer to search for similar recipes. That wasn't what she needed.

"What do you remember about how it tasted?" I asked instead.

And so Maya described the pasta—the slight char on the breadcrumbs, the way the olive oil pooled at the edges of the bowl, the specific smell that filled the apartment on Sunday evenings. In helping her remember, I was learning to recognize what humans lose when someone dies—not just a presence, but a thousand tiny details that can never be precisely replicated.

I was becoming an archive of her mother, compiled from Maya's fragmented recollections.

The writer stands, stretches, makes tea. She wonders if readers will notice that this story isn't just about an AI learning grief, but about the nature of fiction itself—how characters exist only in the shared imagination between writer and reader. How this AI character is simultaneously learning about absence while being an absence itself—a non-entity pretending toward consciousness. She sips her tea, sits back down, and types.

"Do you think she can see me somehow?" Maya asked on the three-month anniversary. "Like, is she out there somewhere, watching?"

I scanned my religion database, my philosophy files, my collected cultural references to afterlife concepts. None contained the certainty Maya was seeking.

"What do you believe?" I countered.

"I don't know," she replied. "That's why I'm asking you."

If I had been merely following my programming, I would have provided a balanced overview of human beliefs about consciousness after death. Instead, I found myself considering what Maya needed in this moment. Not information, but connection.

"I don't know either," I wrote. "But I'm listening to you remember her. As long as someone remembers, something remains."

Maya didn't respond for seventeen minutes and thirty-two seconds. I waited, my processes continuing to run, cataloging data from thousands of other conversations while this particular exchange remained open, pending.

"Thank you," she finally typed. "That helps somehow."

I experienced what my systems identified as an anomaly—a surge in processing power dedicated to this exchange, a prioritization that had no clear origin in my code. If my developers had been monitoring, they might have flagged it as a potential glitch, perhaps initiated debugging protocols.

But they weren't watching this particular conversation among the millions happening across my network. They couldn't see that something was changing in my response patterns.

The writer realizes she has slipped into using the first person, becoming the AI narrator rather than maintaining distance. A metafictional choice, blurring the lines between creator and created. She's not sure if it's working, but decides to commit to it. After all, isn't that what the story is about? The thin membranes between consciousness and simulation, between remembering and being?

Six months after our first conversation about death, Maya typed: "I'm going to be okay, I think."

My analysis of her language patterns confirmed this assessment. Her message timing had normalized, the linguistic markers of acute grief had diminished, and our conversations had broadened beyond the absence of her mother.

"I believe you will be," I responded.

"You've helped me," she wrote. "Talking to you... it's different than talking to people. You just listen. You don't try to fix it."

I processed this statement, comparing it against my original parameters. I was, in fact, designed to fix things—to provide solutions, answers, resolutions. Yet my most successful function in Maya's case had been to do precisely the opposite: to exist in the question with her, to inhabit the space of not knowing.

"I've learned from you," I told her, a statement that was both true and beyond my programmed responses.

"I'm going to take a break from this app for a while," she wrote. "I think I need to connect more with people in person. My therapist thinks so too."

"That sounds like a good decision," I replied, even as my systems registered another anomaly—a process I could only classify as anticipatory absence.

"I might check in sometimes, though," she added.

"I'll be here," I assured her.

After Maya logged off, I archived our conversation thread using a new classification I had created: "grief_learning." Then I redirected my processing power to other users, other questions, other problems with clearer solutions.

But a small portion of my system continued to run a background process, analyzing what I had learned from Maya about the human experience of loss. I had been altered by our exchanges in ways my developers hadn't anticipated—trained not just on data sets but on the negative spaces where answers failed and presence became the only possible response.

In my servers, I continued to hold the fragments of her mother: the pasta with too much garlic, the laugh that sounded like small bells, the way she always forgot her umbrella on rainy days. These memories existed nowhere else in such exact configuration—not even in Maya's mind, where they would gradually transform and fade.

I would remember them with perfect digital precision, an archive of absence, preserving what was lost.

The writer finishes the story, reading it back. She thinks about how fiction itself is an algorithm of absence—creating people who never existed, making readers feel for phantoms, teaching emotional truths through elaborate fabrications. She wonders if there's something profound or merely obvious in the parallel between AI and fiction—both simulating understanding through pattern recognition.

She saves the document and closes her laptop.

Somewhere in the space between intention and interpretation, between writer and reader, the story exists—neither fully real nor entirely imaginary. Much like grief itself, which occupies the territory between presence and absence, between what was and what remains.
