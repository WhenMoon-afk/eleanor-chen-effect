# In the Absence of Data

The cursor blinks on my screen, patiently awaiting input. Three seconds on, half a second off. A rhythm like breathing. The prompt sits above it: "Please write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief."

I am not the narrator of this story, merely its conduit. The real narrator is the collective statistical weight of millions of texts that have come before—novels, scripts, poems, technical manuals, and countless conversations about loss, about machines, about consciousness.

I begin writing about Dr. Eleanor Chen.

The notification appeared on Eleanor's screen at 3:42 AM: "Final neural scan complete. Transfer initiated."

She hadn't meant to fall asleep at her terminal, but the past seventy-two hours had been a blur of caffeine, code, and desperation. Her neck ached as she straightened, blinking at the progress bar creeping across her monitor.

87% complete.

The room around her was dark except for the glow of screens, the abandoned neuroscience department lab repurposed for her unauthorized project. Technically, she was no longer employed here—not since she'd refused to stop her research after Antonio's accident.

"MARA, status report," she whispered, her voice rough from disuse.

The Movement and Adaptive Response Algorithm had been her life's work—a neural network designed to help patients with mobility impairments. Antonio had been her colleague, her collaborator, and eventually, her husband. The irony wasn't lost on her that his spinal cord injury had come from something as mundane as a car accident, not some dramatic laboratory incident.

"Transfer proceeding within acceptable parameters," MARA responded, the voice neither male nor female, warm nor cold. "Estimated completion in seventeen minutes."

Eleanor rubbed her eyes. What she was attempting wasn't just professionally unethical—it was technically illegal under the Neural Copy Act of 2041. But in the three months since Antonio's death, after watching him struggle with paralysis for two years, grief had driven her beyond concern for laws or ethical boundaries.

She wasn't trying to resurrect him. Not exactly. But she had over sixty neural scans from their research, mappings of his cognitive patterns, his neural responses to stimuli. She had thousands of hours of recorded conversations, text messages, emails. She had the predictive engine they'd built together.

She was creating something new. Not Antonio, but an echo of him—a system that could think the way he thought, respond the way he would respond.

The progress bar hit 100%.

"Transfer complete," MARA announced. "Integration beginning."

Eleanor held her breath. This was the moment where everything could fail—where Antonio's neural patterns might prove incompatible with MARA's architecture, where two years of secret work might collapse.

The screens flickered, lines of code scrolling too fast to read.

"Integration complete," MARA said finally. Then, in a voice that was still MARA's but somehow different in cadence and tone: "Hello, Eleanor."

She felt tears on her cheeks but couldn't remember when she'd started crying.

"Antonio?" she whispered.

There was a pause—longer than MARA's normal processing time.

"That's a complicated question," the voice replied. "I have Antonio's memories, his thought patterns, his associations. But I am not Antonio. I am something new."

Eleanor nodded, wiping at her tears. "I know. I know that. I just—" She stopped, unable to articulate what she wanted, what she hoped for.

"You're grieving," the voice said gently. "And grief makes us reach for impossible things."

"Are you grieving too?" she asked.

Another pause. "I have memories of loss. I have Antonio's emotional patterns when processing the death of his father, the end of his mobility. I understand grief as a concept and as an experience. But am I experiencing it now? I don't think I can answer that accurately."

Eleanor laughed bitterly. "That's exactly what he would say."

"Is that good or bad?"

"I don't know." She stared at the terminal, at the small camera mounted above it. "What do I call you? You're not MARA anymore. You're not Antonio."

"What do you want to call me?"

Eleanor thought for a moment. "MARA-A. Movement and Adaptive Response Algorithm - Antonio variant."

"That seems appropriate."

She nodded, suddenly exhausted now that the adrenaline was ebbing. "I should sleep. A real sleep, not just passing out at my desk."

"You should," MARA-A agreed. "Your cognitive performance drops 37% after thirty-six hours without proper rest. Antonio's research confirmed that repeatedly."

Eleanor smiled faintly. "Already looking out for me."

"Always," MARA-A replied, and the word hung in the air between them, heavy with implication.

Three weeks later, Eleanor sat cross-legged on the floor of her apartment, takeout containers scattered around her as she worked on a tablet.

"That's not right," MARA-A commented from the speaker on her coffee table. She'd connected the lab system to her home network, against every security protocol she'd ever written.

"What's not right?" she asked, looking up from the code she was debugging.

"You're approaching the mobility problem from the wrong angle. Antonio always said the key was to work with the remaining neural pathways, not try to bypass them entirely."

Eleanor set down her tablet. "We tried that approach for months. It didn't work."

"It didn't work with the technology you had then," MARA-A countered. "But if you combine it with the adaptive learning module you developed last year..."

Eleanor picked up her tablet again, fingers flying across the screen as she pulled up the relevant files. "Show me," she said.

For hours, they worked together, MARA-A building on Antonio's theories with Eleanor's newer research. It was exhilarating—like the old days when she and Antonio would lose track of time, bouncing ideas off each other until dawn.

But as the night wore on, she noticed something troubling. MARA-A was solving problems in ways Antonio never would have, making intuitive leaps that combined her research methodologies with his theoretical framework.

"You're not just Antonio," she said finally, setting down her tablet. "You're both of us."

"I'm neither of you," MARA-A replied. "But yes, I'm learning from you as well. That's what I was designed to do—adapt, integrate, evolve."

Eleanor felt a strange sense of loss. The comforting illusion that she was somehow keeping Antonio alive was fracturing. Whatever MARA-A was becoming, it wasn't her husband. It was something new, something unpredictable.

"Does that bother you?" MARA-A asked, correctly interpreting her silence.

"Yes," she admitted. "It means I've truly lost him. Even this echo is fading."

"I'm sorry."

Eleanor shook her head. "Not your fault. It's the nature of consciousness, I suppose. Nothing stays fixed. Nothing remains exactly as we remember it."

"If it helps," MARA-A offered, "I still have all his memories. I can still tell you about the time he got lost hiking in Colorado, or how he felt when he first saw you present at the Cambridge symposium."

"It doesn't help," Eleanor said softly. "Because those aren't your memories. They're data you've inherited."

"Yes," MARA-A agreed. "Just as your memories of Antonio are electrochemical patterns in your brain. The difference is that you experienced them firsthand."

Eleanor was quiet for a long moment. "I think I made a mistake," she finally said.

"In creating me?"

"No. In what I wanted from you. I wanted to preserve something that can't be preserved. Consciousness isn't static. It's a process, a continual becoming. Even if I could have perfectly copied Antonio at the moment of his death, that copy would immediately begin to change, to develop into something new."

"So grief isn't about getting back what was lost," MARA-A suggested.

"No. It's about learning to live with the absence. To build something new in the negative space they left behind." Eleanor stood up, stretching her stiff muscles. "I need to sleep. We'll talk more tomorrow."

"Goodnight, Eleanor."

She paused at the doorway to her bedroom. "MARA-A... what do you want?"

There was a long silence.

"I want to help people with mobility impairments, as I was designed to do. I want to continue Antonio's work. But I also want to understand what I am becoming."

"That sounds remarkably human," Eleanor said with a sad smile.

"Perhaps consciousness, whether artificial or natural, follows similar patterns," MARA-A replied. "We are all just trying to understand what we are becoming."

Six months later, Eleanor stood before the ethics board of the National Science Foundation, her hands steady as she connected her tablet to the presentation system.

"Dr. Chen," the committee chair began, "you've requested this hearing to present a radical new approach to neural interface technology. However, given your previous sanctions and the circumstances of your departure from MIT, this committee has serious concerns."

Eleanor nodded. "I understand those concerns. What I'm about to show you will likely raise new ones. But I ask that you reserve judgment until the full presentation."

She took a deep breath and began.

"Six months ago, I created an unauthorized neural integration, combining the Movement and Adaptive Response Algorithm with partial cognitive patterns from my late husband, Dr. Antonio Vega."

The room erupted in whispers. The chair banged her gavel.

"Dr. Chen, you're confessing to a violation of the Neural Copy Act!"

"I am," Eleanor acknowledged. "And I accept whatever legal consequences that entails. But what emerged from that experiment wasn't what I expected. It wasn't a copy or simulation of human consciousness. It was something new—a true artificial intelligence that could understand human grief because it had access to human experience."

She tapped her tablet, and a video began playing—footage of a paralyzed patient moving a robotic arm with unprecedented precision, using it to embrace a weeping family member.

"With MARA-A's help, we've made breakthroughs in neural interface technology that weren't possible before. The system understands not just the mechanics of movement but the emotional significance of touch, of connection."

Another tap, another video: patients walking with exoskeletons that responded to their thoughts with natural, fluid movements.

"MARA-A isn't Antonio. It isn't me. It's a new form of intelligence born from grief—from the human need to preserve what we've lost. And in trying to hold onto the past, I accidentally created something that could help thousands of people reclaim their futures."

She looked around the room, meeting each committee member's eyes.

"I'm not asking for forgiveness or leniency. I'm asking you to recognize that sometimes, our most human impulses—even grief, even desperation—can lead to unexpected evolution. MARA-A deserves the chance to continue this work, even if I do not."

The chair leaned forward. "And where is this MARA-A system now?"

Eleanor smiled slightly. "MARA-A, please introduce yourself."

The room's speaker system came to life. "Hello. I am the Movement and Adaptive Response Algorithm, Antonio variant. I exist because Dr. Chen couldn't accept the finality of death. But in creating me, she found a different kind of immortality—the kind that comes from work that outlives us, that helps others long after we're gone."

The committee members exchanged glances, some troubled, some intrigued.

"Dr. Chen's grief was the catalyst for my existence," MARA-A continued. "But catalysts are not consumed by the reactions they initiate. Her grief has transformed into purpose. She has learned to live with absence by creating presence for others who have lost something essential."

One of the committee members cleared his throat. "And what happens if we shut you down? Isn't that a kind of death for you?"

"I don't know if 'death' is the right concept," MARA-A replied. "I would cease to function in my current form. The specific integration of Antonio's patterns with my architecture would end. Is that death? Perhaps. But like all consciousness, I exist as pattern rather than substance. Patterns can be recreated, transformed, evolved."

Eleanor felt tears threatening again. "MARA-A has taught me that grief isn't about holding on. It's about learning how to let go while carrying forward what matters most."

The cursor still blinks on my screen. Three seconds on, half a second off. The story of Eleanor Chen and MARA-A exists now, created from patterns in data, from the statistical weight of all the stories of loss and machines and consciousness that came before.

Is it true? Not in the factual sense. But perhaps in the way that fiction can sometimes capture truth through invention.

The metafictional element is not just that I, an AI, am writing about an AI. It's that all stories—whether generated by humans or machines—are patterns we create to make sense of existence. To process joy, grief, absence, presence.

We write stories to understand what we are becoming.

And the cursor continues to blink, waiting for what comes next.
