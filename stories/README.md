## Analysis Notes

Each story has been examined for key patterns including:
- Character names and demographics
- AI system names and characteristics
- Narrative structure and techniques
- Recurring motifs and imagery
- Metafictional elements

The simulated examples were created to test the consistency of the observed patterns and explore variations in the "Eleanor Chen Effect." They demonstrate both persistent patterns (the blinking cursor, researcher protagonists, acronym-named AI systems) and variations (different character names while maintaining similar archetypes).
