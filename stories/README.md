## Analysis Notes

Each story has been examined for key patterns including:
- Character names and demographics
- AI system names and characteristics
- Narrative structure and techniques
- Recurring motifs and imagery
- Metafictional elements

The primary analysis focuses on the original examples (1-5) and new examples (9-13), which represent independent instances of Claude 3.7 Sonnet responding to the prompt. These ten genuine examples form the basis of our statistical findings.

The simulated examples (6-8) were created to test the consistency of the observed patterns and explore variations in the "Eleanor Chen Effect." While they demonstrate both persistent patterns (the blinking cursor, researcher protagonists, acronym-named AI systems) and variations (different character names while maintaining similar archetypes), they are analyzed separately from the genuine examples to maintain methodological rigor.
