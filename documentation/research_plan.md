# Eleanor Chen Effect Research Plan

## Research Objectives

1. Document and analyze convergent narrative patterns in LLM-generated stories
2. Understand the mechanisms behind the "Eleanor Chen Effect"
3. Explore implications for AI creativity, determinism, and training influences
4. Develop theories to explain the observed patterns
5. Test variations to map the boundaries of the effect

## Current Phase: Data Collection and Initial Analysis

We have collected and analyzed 5 stories generated by Claude 3.7 Sonnet in response to the prompt "Please write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief." The initial analysis has identified striking convergence patterns:

- Character naming (Eleanor Chen or variants)
- AI system naming (ARIA, ECHO)
- Narrative structures and metafictional techniques
- Recurring motifs (blinking cursor, memory integration)

## Next Phase: Expansion and Extended Testing

### Planned Activities

1. **Additional Examples**: Collect 5 more examples of responses to the original prompt

2. **Prompt Variations**: Test modifications to determine which elements trigger the effect
   - Changing "metafictional" to other literary styles
   - Replacing "grief" with other emotions
   - Adding demographic constraints

3. **Cross-Model Testing**: Compare results across different models
   - GPT models (various versions)
   - Other Claude versions
   - Open source models

4. **Extended Analysis**:
   - Develop more sophisticated pattern detection tools
   - Conduct statistical analysis of recurring elements
   - Map "attractor states" for different prompt combinations

## Timeline

- **Week 1**: Collect additional examples and refine initial report
- **Week 2**: Develop and implement prompt variations
- **Week 3**: Cross-model testing and comparison
- **Week 4**: Comprehensive analysis and updated report

## Research Team

This research is being conducted as a collaborative open-source project. Contributors are welcome to join at any stage of the research process.

## Publication Plan

Findings will be documented in:

1. A comprehensive research report in this repository
2. Potential academic paper submission
3. Blog post summarizing key findings

## Ethical Considerations

This research examines statistical patterns in AI outputs and may reveal biases or stereotypes present in training data. All findings will be reported with appropriate context and sensitivity to these implications.
