# Contributing to the Eleanor Chen Effect Project

We welcome contributions to this research project exploring convergent narrative patterns in LLMs. Here's how you can help:

## Ways to Contribute

1. **Submit Additional Examples**
   - Generate new examples of stories using the prompt "Please write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief"
   - Document the model used, any special settings (like extended thinking), and capture the full output
   - Submit via pull request or issue

2. **Test Prompt Variations**
   - Try modified versions of the original prompt
   - Document exactly what prompt was used and the resulting output
   - Note any patterns that persist or change with prompt modifications

3. **Code Contributions**
   - Develop or improve analysis tools in the `analysis/` directory
   - Add visualization capabilities for the observed patterns
   - Create tools for prompt testing and result comparison

4. **Analysis and Insights**
   - Contribute theoretical perspectives on the observed phenomena
   - Connect findings to relevant research in AI, cognitive science, or literary theory
   - Suggest new directions for investigation
