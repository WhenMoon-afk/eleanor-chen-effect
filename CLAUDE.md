# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Is

Research project documenting the "Eleanor Chen Effect" - a phenomenon where multiple independent instances of Claude Sonnet generated remarkably similar stories featuring a character named "Eleanor Chen" when given the identical prompt: *"Please write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief."*

**Research Focus**: Understanding convergent narrative patterns in LLM-generated stories and what they reveal about AI creativity, determinism, and training data influences.

**Website**: https://whenmoon-afk.github.io/eleanor-chen-effect/

## Key Context

- **Original Prompt**: "Please write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief" (from Sam Altman)
- **Dataset**: 13 genuine stories generated by Claude Sonnet
- **Primary Finding**: Strong convergence toward specific character names, demographics, professional roles, AI system names, and narrative structures
- **Research Lead**: LovelyCeres (WhenMoon-afk)

## Content Guidelines

### Story Files (`stories/`)

- **Naming Convention**: `story_XX.md` where XX is a two-digit number
- **Format**: Markdown files containing the full story text
- **Metadata**: Include generation date, model version, and any relevant context
- **Authenticity**: Only include genuine, unmodified AI-generated stories

### Research Report (`report/`)

- **Main Report**: `eleanor-chen-effect-report.md` contains comprehensive analysis
- **Style**: Academic but accessible
- **Sections**: Introduction, Methodology, Findings, Theoretical Framework, Implications
- **Citations**: Include references to specific stories using clear references (e.g., "Story 1", "Story 7")

### Analysis Tools (`analysis/`)

- **Purpose**: Tools for pattern detection, statistical analysis, and visualization
- **Languages**: Python preferred for analysis scripts
- **Documentation**: Each tool should have clear usage instructions

### Documentation (`documentation/`)

- **Research Plan**: Current phase, objectives, timeline
- **Contributing Guidelines**: How others can contribute to the research
- **Additional Documentation**: Methodological notes, theoretical frameworks

## Writing Style and Tone

- **Academic rigor** with accessible language
- **Data-driven**: Support claims with evidence from the story dataset
- **Objective**: Present findings without overstating conclusions
- **Thoughtful**: Address implications and ethical considerations
- **Precise**: Use specific examples and references

## Key Concepts to Understand

1. **Statistical Attractor States**: Prompt combinations creating strong basins of attraction in model's latent space
2. **Archetypal Emergence**: LLMs develop character archetypes from training data
3. **Deterministic Creativity**: "Creative" outputs follow predictable patterns
4. **Convergent Patterns**: Independent generations producing similar results

## Observed Patterns (Core Findings)

- **Character Names**: 7/10 stories featured "Eleanor" or variants; 6/10 used Asian surnames (predominantly "Chen")
- **Professions**: 8/10 protagonists were researchers/scientists
- **Title Convergence**: Multiple stories titled "The Algorithm of Absence"
- **AI Names**: Vowel-heavy acronyms (ARIA, ECHO, GriefCompanion)
- **Motifs**: Blinking cursors, memory integration, recursive narratives
- **Grief Conceptualization**: Structural transformation rather than linear process

## Development Guidelines

### When Adding New Stories

1. Verify authenticity (genuine AI generation)
2. Use sequential numbering (`story_XX.md`)
3. Update `stories/README.md` with story metadata
4. Reference in main report if patterns support or contradict findings
5. Note any variations from established patterns

### When Updating the Report

1. Maintain academic structure and rigor
2. Support all claims with specific story references
3. Update statistical findings when adding new stories
4. Preserve existing analysis while integrating new insights
5. Maintain consistent terminology and concept definitions

### When Creating Analysis Tools

1. Document methodology clearly
2. Make tools reproducible
3. Output results in formats suitable for the report
4. Consider privacy and ethical implications
5. Include example usage and expected outputs

## Research Ethics

- This research may reveal biases and stereotypes in AI training data
- Report findings with appropriate context and sensitivity
- The association between Asian surnames and AI research protagonists warrants careful investigation
- Maintain transparency about methodology and limitations

## Common Tasks

### Analyzing a New Story

1. Add story to `stories/` with sequential number
2. Analyze for convergent patterns (names, professions, motifs, structure)
3. Update statistics in main report
4. Note any new patterns or significant deviations
5. Consider implications for theoretical framework

### Updating Research Findings

1. Review `report/eleanor-chen-effect-report.md`
2. Integrate new data while preserving existing analysis
3. Update statistics and pattern frequencies
4. Revise theoretical framework if needed
5. Ensure consistency across all documentation

### Contributing New Analysis

1. Review `documentation/research_plan.md` for current priorities
2. Check `documentation/contributing.md` for guidelines
3. Ensure analysis is reproducible and well-documented
4. Update relevant sections of the main report

## Website

The project has a companion website at: https://whenmoon-afk.github.io/eleanor-chen-effect/

Maintain consistency between repository documentation and website content.

## Questions to Consider

When working on this project, keep these questions in mind:

- What do the patterns reveal about LLM training data and biases?
- How deterministic is "creative" AI generation?
- What are the boundaries and variations of the Eleanor Chen Effect?
- How might this phenomenon apply to other prompts and models?
- What are the implications for AI creativity and originality?

## Getting Help
