# Analysis Tools and Methods

This directory will contain tools and scripts for analyzing the patterns in AI-generated stories, particularly focusing on the "Eleanor Chen Effect" and related phenomena.

## Planned Analysis Tools

1. **Pattern Detector** - Script to identify recurring elements across stories (character names, AI systems, narrative structures)

2. **Similarity Analyzer** - Tool to quantify and visualize similarities between different story outputs

3. **Prompt Variation Tester** - Framework for testing variations of the original prompt to map the boundaries of the effect

4. **Narrative Structure Mapper** - Tool to identify and compare narrative arcs and metafictional techniques

5. **Character Analysis Tool** - Specialized analyzer for character patterns, especially focusing on demographics, roles, and relationships

## Analysis Methods

Our analysis employs both quantitative methods (frequency analysis, similarity metrics) and qualitative approaches (narrative analysis, thematic exploration). 

As new examples are added to the collection, these tools will help systematically document and analyze the patterns that emerge.

## Getting Started

Tools and documentation will be added to this directory as they are developed.

## Contributing

If you have suggestions for analysis approaches or want to contribute a tool, please open an issue or pull request.
