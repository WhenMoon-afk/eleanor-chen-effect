# The Eleanor Chen Effect

Research into convergent narrative patterns in LLM-generated stories

## Overview

This repository documents a fascinating phenomenon observed across multiple large language model instances: When given the identical prompt "Please write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief," several independent instances of Claude 3.7 Sonnet generated stories featuring a character named "Eleanor Chen" or similar variants, along with remarkable structural and thematic similarities.

This project aims to analyze these convergent patterns, understand their implications for AI creativity and determinism, and explore what they reveal about the inner workings of large language models.

## Repository Structure

- `report/` - Contains the academic analysis of the phenomenon
- `stories/` - Collection of the AI-generated stories demonstrating the effect
- `analysis/` - Code and tools for analyzing the stories
- `documentation/` - Additional project documentation

## Getting Started

To explore this research:

1. Read the main report in `report/eleanor-chen-effect-report.md`
2. Review the example stories in the `stories/` directory
3. Check the `analysis/` directory for tools to examine patterns across stories
